# Build setup

**This project uses yarn for package management. Install it here first [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)**

You can also install yarn via npm (npm i -g yarn), but you may run into issues later.

*React Native install instructions: [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)*

**Note: We had trouble building this on windows, but it works fine on mac and linux (android or ios).**
